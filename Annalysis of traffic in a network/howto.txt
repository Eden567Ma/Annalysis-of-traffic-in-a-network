Project Summary

This project integrates all the knowledge we have acquired so far. It covers various aspects such as the components of a frame, the size, and the content of these fields. It also delves into the main procedures crucial for extracting protocols and defining their values.

This work has been briefly introduced in our video. In addition to that, here is this file which outlines the steps to be taken.
Execution Steps

    Download and Unzip the repository.
    To run the program, simply execute the following commands:
    a. python visualizer.py to run the code.
    It's normal if no graph is generated at this point because this command also generates a .puml file containing the necessary information to draw the graph.
    b. napkin_plantuml visualization.puml visualization.txt to draw the graph by generating a .txt file containing the flow graph to be displayed.

Program Execution Process

After the fundamental commands necessary for the proper functioning of the program, here are the steps that may be given during the process:

After running the first command, you will be prompted to enter a file to process. Please enter a valid text file name. You will also be asked if you want to use a filter. Please respond with "yes" or "no". If yes, specify the type of filter you want to use, either a filter by IP address or by protocol. Then, enter the protocol or IP address to filter.
Graphical Interface

The main display has indeed been established in the terminal. The following serves as a complement to the video. So please carefully review the commands to correctly install the libraries. In our case, PILLOW and Tkinter.

After installation, the only remaining procedure is to press the run button of the inter.py file.
